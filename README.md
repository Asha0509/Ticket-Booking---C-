# Ticket Booking System (C)

## Description
This project is a simple **Movie Ticket Booking System** implemented in C. It allows users to:

1. **Book a ticket** - Choose a movie, timing, and seat.
2. **Cancel a ticket** - Remove a booking using the Ticket ID.
3. **View bookings** - See all current bookings.
4. **View available seats** - Check which seats are free.
5. **Exit the system**.

The system efficiently manages ticket reservations using **Queue Data Structure**, ensuring proper sequential handling of bookings and cancellations.

## Features
- **Queue Management**: Ensures tickets are processed in order.
- **Seat Availability Tracking**: Allows users to check and select available seats.
- **Receipt Generation**: Provides a formatted receipt after booking.
- **Cancellation**: Users can cancel a booked ticket by entering their Ticket ID.
- **User-friendly Interface**: Simple menu-based interaction.

## How to Run
1. Compile the program using GCC:
   ```sh
   gcc ticket_booking.c -o ticket_booking
   ```
2. Run the compiled program:
   ```sh
   ./ticket_booking
   ```
3. Follow the on-screen menu to book, cancel, or view tickets.
